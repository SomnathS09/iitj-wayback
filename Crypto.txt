- Shannon's law perfect secrecy

Adversarial games - IND-C** variants (m0, m1)

if we pick any random string in the output set it is not likely to have been produced by this algo

Probabilistic polynomial time algo (PPT) - internal coin toss, also gets a random string input

One way function vs Trapdoor one way function

a PRG takes a short seed and produces a long output which looks like random.

Using PRG to create ENC algo

Stream : RC4 256B, Key- 8 to 16B, WEP construction, A5/1, A5/3, Sync - Init vector, 
& Block ciphers

Adversarial games - IND-C** variants (m0, m1), CPA, CCA

PRF=>
This scheme is CPA secure because of PRF property
This scheme is NOT CCA secure

Modes of operation in stream : ECB, CBC, Chained CBC, CTR, OFB

- Fiestal cipher & 3+1 Secure PRP
used in DES (Subs-Box & Perm is for diffusion)

- PRG (seed value n << 1), PRF, PRP, 
- DES, 2-DES keysize (K1, K2) = 112bit key, & 3-DES (K1,K1,K2) 

Every finite field of same size is isomorphic to each other
The no of elements in a finite field are p^n for some prime p & some int n
