Please fill your paper preferences in the shared sheet linked below. I will fill column 2 (approved?) and then you can read the paper and submit a 2-3 page summary of the paper. As discussed in the class, the paper should cover privacy or security concerns. Preferably, the paper should be related to psychological aspects or understanding the adversaries. These are the topics we have covered in the class till now. Hence, I would like you to focus on only those aspects. (No cryptography paper, no network security paper etc. Those can be studied only if the focus is on usability or privacy concerns. Such papers can also be studied if they are about how adversaries can utilize the tools at their disposal to attack people.)

Please fill your preferences quickly so that you can start reading the paper. I will try to look at the sheet at least every day and either approve or disallow the suggested paper.
